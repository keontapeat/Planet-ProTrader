GoldexBot Current Status Summary
Date: July 17, 2025, 06:18 AM EDT
Location: Ubuntu 22.04 Linode VPS at /opt/goldex-bot

Current State
‚úÖ Working Components
* Xvfb virtual display: Running on display :1 (PID 2975)
* MT5 Terminal: Successfully running via Wine (PID 4260)
* Python in Wine: Installed at /root/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Python39/python.exe
* Virtual Environment: Active at /opt/goldex-bot/venv

‚ùå Issues Resolved
* mt5linux 0.1.9 and mt5linux-updated 0.0.1 both fail with RPyC server errors
* Python installer was successfully reinstalled in Wine after interruption

üìÅ Current Files Available

Next Steps (Where to Continue)

1. Immediate Next Command
 head -50 goldex_bot.py
 cat .env

 This will show the bot configuration and how it currently connects to MT5.

2. Goal: Modify bot to work directly with MT5
 Since mt5linux-updated RPyC server is failing, we need to:
 * Remove RPyC dependencies from the bot
 * Configure direct MT5 connection
 * Set up demo account credentials
 * Test the bot with gold trading (XAUUSD)

3. Required Demo Account Info
 You‚Äôll need to configure in .env:
 * DEMO_LOGIN (demo account number)
 * DEMO_PASSWORD (demo account password)
 * DEMO_SERVER (demo server name)
 * Gold symbol verification (XAUUSD, GOLD, or XAUUSDm)

4. Final Steps After Bot Modification
 * Test bot connection to MT5
 * Verify gold symbol availability
 * Run bot and monitor logs
 * Set up persistent execution with tmux

Key Commands for New Chat

# Navigate to project
cd /opt/goldex-bot
source venv/bin/activate

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep -E "(Xvfb|terminal64)"

# Expected: Xvfb on :1 and terminal64.exe running
# If not running, restart with:
# Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24 &
# DISPLAY=:1 wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/MetaTrader\ 5/terminal64.exe &

Problem Summary
The RPyC server approach (mt5linux/mt5linux-updated) is failing due to package bugs. The solution is to modify the existing bot to connect directly to MT5 without the intermediate RPyC server, which is more reliable anyway.

Current Status: Ready to examine and modify the bot code to work directly with MT5.
