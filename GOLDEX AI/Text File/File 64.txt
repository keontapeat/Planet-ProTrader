# How To Delete All Saved Logins From MetaTrader 5 and Only Use Your Demo Account (VPS/Terminal)

## If you're running MT5 on your VPS (via Wine, Linux, or Windows):

### Method 1: Delete/Reset Config Files (Delete All Saved Logins)

1. **Close MetaTrader 5** completely (all terminals).
2. **Find your MT5 data directory:**
   - For Wine/Linux:  
     `/root/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/MetaTrader 5/config/`
   - For Windows:  
     `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\<SomeID>\config`
3. **Delete (or rename) these files:**
   - `accounts.dat` (stores saved login accounts)
   - `login.ini`
   - `srv.list` (servers list, optional)
4. **Reopen MT5**
   - MT5 will now ask you to login again (no accounts will be saved/auto-filled).
   - Enter **ONLY your demo account** credentials.
   - Check 'Save account information' if you want auto-login, or leave unchecked for manual control.

### Method 2: Remove Specific Accounts from MT5 Interface (Windows Only)

1. In MT5, go to **File > Login to Trade Account...**
2. Before logging in, click the drop-down list beside "Login:" field.  
   Youâ€™ll see previous logins listed.
3. Click the account you want to remove and press the **Delete** key (or right-click, then Delete).
4. Repeat for all accounts except the demo/account you want to keep.

### Command-line Approach (Linux/Wine/Terminal)
